I am switching my career from being a teacher to a software engineer.

<!--more-->

The journey started in 2013 when I was a teacher in a private school in [Poris Indah](https://www.porisindah.sch.id/), Tangerang. I taught Computer Science to elementary school students. I think being a software engineer is exciting and challenging, a software engineer able to make an instruction to a computer to do something and I think the computer will useful for in the future.
