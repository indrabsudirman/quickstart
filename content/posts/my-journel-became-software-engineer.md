I am switching my career from being a teacher to a software engineer.

<!--more-->

The journey started in 2013 when I was a teacher in a private school in [Poris Indah](https://www.porisindah.sch.id/), Tangerang. I taught Computer Science to elementary school students. I think being a software engineer is exciting and challenging, a software engineer able to make an instruction to a computer to do something and I think the computer skills will be useful in the future.

During 2013 - 2015, I learned basic programming languages like C. I watched some tutorials on YouTube, but I failed to understand even basic concepts such as variables and functions. In 2016, I decided to came in University of [Indraprasta PGRI](https://unindra.ac.id/) Jakarta Selatan to study Computer Science. In 2020, I graduated but it was pandemic so I was not able to find a job as a software engineer.

During 2020 - 2022, while I was actively looking for a job, I was active improving my programming skills by creating some Android projects and others.
